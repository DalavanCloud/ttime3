# ttime3 [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lutzky/ttime3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lutzky/ttime3)

Yet another rewrite of ttime. This version reads JSON files as exported by https://github.com/lutzky/repy, and uses web workers to perform heavy computations in the background.

## Dev notes

* Run `npm test`, it'll perform lint tests and such
* Run `npm run fix` to fix formatting
